Professional issues in US

- By 2000, ultrasound had become the most widely used diagnostic imaging technique throughout the world.
- In the UK, US investigations now 22% of all diagnostic exams (2011).


Two differing environments where ultrasound imaging is utilised:
- POCUS (Physiotherapy, Rheumatology, ED, Orthopaedics)
- Radiology

Standards of practice:
- Guidelines for professional practice documents provided by 
a) Royal College of Radiologists and 
b) British Medical Ultrasound Society


Consider reporting, image storage & quality assurance 

Safety:
- Look to maximise the clinical benefit of the exam 
- Duration of the scan should be limited to that required for clinical reasons 

Infection control
 Develop cleaning protocols and procedures
a) Contact US manufacturer
b) Speak to employer/department
c) Establish protocol esp for guided interventions 
- Clean with correct agents for specific probes
- Hand wash
- Keep a logbook
- Develop a step by step process

Documentation:
- Images as part of an ultrasound examination provide a valuable record of findings to support the final report

Audit:
Images are only representative of the examination, rather than the complete record.
A holistic view of the quality of an ultrasound exam encompases: 
Clinical question – clear and appropriate?
Image quality –good, acceptable, poor.
Report quality – good, acceptable, poor.
Clinical question answered?
