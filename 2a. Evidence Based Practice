We discuss:
1. What EBP is 
"Application of clinical decisions from research based evidence"
- To inform decision making rather than following a rigid routine
- To inform but not completely replace expertise 
2. Why EBP developed
- Can guide diagnosis, prognosis, therapy and prevention 
- Underpins ability to assess and treat 
- Resolve disparity between evidence & practice, and variations in clinical care
- Can allow public health planning and decisions around resource allocation
3. Developments facilitating EBP 
- Creation of information systems capable of searching evidence from across the world in seconds 
4. Aims of EBP 
- To be aware of and pay attention to best findings from healthcare research to be scientifically vaild and ready for application
5. EBP in clinical practice 

Steps:
1) Convert need for information into an answerable question
2) Track down best evidence to answer a question 
3) Critically appraise evidence for validity 
4) Integrating evidence with our expertise and patients presentation, values and circumstances 
5) Evaluating our effectiveness and seeking ways to improve for next time 

- Criticisms:
a) Patients are infinitely complex, can be a disconnect in application to an individual person 
b) May tell us what we are doing is wrong, question over weather EDP actually works and improves outcomes 
 
- Limitations
**Too broad and ability to extrapolate can be difficult**
a) Ignores patient preference
b) Denigrates clinical expertise
c) Leads to nihilsm - if no treatment is therepeutically supported
d) Limited to clinical research
