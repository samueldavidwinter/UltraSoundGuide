A) Anterior Shoulder 
- Long Head of Biceps Tendon

B) Superior Shoulder
- Acromioclavicular Joint

C) Anterolateral Shoulder
- Superaspinatus Tendon

D) Posterior Shoulder 
• Glenohumeral joint and glenoid labrum
• Infraspinatus tendon and teres minor
• Suprascapular nerve

AI) Position
Transducer Position
- The long head of the biceps brachii is located lateral to that of the short head. 
- On initial placement of the transducer, start lateral to the region where the short head can be palpated.
Transducer Tips
On short axis, angle the transducer superiorly to
eliminate echogenicity of the tendon. The degree
of external rotation of the forearm will directly
influence the position of the long head of the biceps
brachii tendon relative to the head of the humerus.
Adjust the patient’s forearm such that the long head
appears centered over the humerus.
Patient Position
Seat your patient with the shoulder adducted and elbow
flexed to approximately 90°. Supinate the forearm and rest
it on the thig
