A) Anterior Shoulder 
- Long Head of Biceps Tendon

B) Superior Shoulder
- Acromioclavicular Joint

C) Anterolateral Shoulder
- Superaspinatus Tendon

D) Posterior Shoulder 
• Glenohumeral joint and glenoid labrum
• Infraspinatus tendon and teres minor
• Suprascapular nerve

AI) Position
Patient Position
- Seat your patient with the shoulder adducted and elbow flexed to approximately 90°. 
- Supinate the forearm and rest it on the thigh 

Transducer Position
- The long head of the biceps brachii is located lateral to that of the short head. 
- On initial placement of the transducer, start lateral to the region where the short head can be palpated.
Transducer Tips
- Adjust the patient’s forearm such that the long head appears centered over the humerus.

Aii) Assess the following
• Integrity of the cortical surface and depth of the bicipital groove
• Thickness and echogenicity of the tendon
• Assess for fluid within the tendon sheath
• Assess for neovascularisation
