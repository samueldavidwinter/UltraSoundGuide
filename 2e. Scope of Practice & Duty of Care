Duty of Care
- Our legal duty to provide a reasonable
standard of care to your patients and to act in ways that
protect their safety
- A duty of care exists when it could
reasonably be expected that a person’s actions, or
failure to act, might cause injury to another person

Chartered Society of Physiotherapists – Information Paper
Duty of Care (January 2013)


Duty of care is the first of threesteps that needs to be
established in seeking to prove alleged clinical negligence
1. The defendant owed a duty of care
2. The HCPC was in breach of this
3. that the harm caused was due to this breach of duty

of Care (January 2013)

‘The Bolam Test’: “The test is the standard of the
ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to
have that special skill. A man need not possess the
highest expert skill... it is sufficient if he exercises the
skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that
particular art.”
The test involves comparison with peers of the
same profession, and not with the skills expected
from a different profession

Competencies
US operators must:
•Adequately train in scanning and interpretation (The
Royal College of Radiologists,2012)
•Maintain CPD
•Be reflective in practice
•Work within their practice scope


Extended Scope of Practice –
• Individual competence is determined by governance and
regulation, rules of professional conduct, job description
and contract of employment
• Demonstre evidence of knowledge skills and competence through professional
qualifications and portfolios as well as professional
justification for the use of evidence

Extended Scope of Practice –
Competencies
• Legal Principles Marrangon & Buttress (2008)
• A practitioner should always meet the usual standard of care,
know their limitations if in doubt and should consult a
more experienced colleague with particular expertise
• Practice should follow existing guidelines - with evidence of
evaluation of the guidelines against the situation & depart from guidelines if and when necessary


• Bolam v Friern Barnet Hospital Management Committee
(1957)
• Judgement: “with a practice accepted as proper by a
responsible body of A doctor is not guilty of negligence is
he has acted in accordance medical men skilled in that
particular art”
• On this basis Bolam lost the case


Scope of practice has changed:
- In the mid 1990’s changes to doctors working ours
practices to limit numbers of hours worked put further
pressures on NHS resources
- This coupled with expanding and aging population meant
NHS resources would be further stretched
- The Department of Health looked at utilising the workforce
and expanded existing scope of practice for nurses and
many allied health professions
- The extension of roles included the extension of many existing roles for non-medical practitioners to train to perform
roles traditionally performed only by medical practitioners
- Such as:
 a) Nonmedical prescribing
 b) Experienced radiographers performing roles such as:
     - Reporting on X-rays
     - Performing interventional procedures
However, radiologists delegating work to radiographers in the UK are constrained by the General Medical Council guideline

- Whilst increasing practioner responsibility, ESPs have been shown to a) improve access and b) reduce waiting times 

Summary
- Operating within a ‘Scope of Practice’ is one of these core principles of professional practice that clinicians must
adhere too. 
- ‘Scope of Practice’ means within the limits of an individuals knowledge and skills, requiring the individual to possess and demonstrate 
a) The knowledge, b) skills and c) competency to provide safe and effective care to their patients within an area of practice such as
performing musculoskeletal ultrasound

• All health care workers have a ‘Duty of Care’ to provide a reasonable standard of care to patients and act in ways to
protect safety
• An individuals scope of practice can change and evolve with experience and appropriate additional training

• Hart et al (2008) highlight the need for engagement with initial and on-going professional and 
service audit of practice and outcome to ensure ongoing standards of care
